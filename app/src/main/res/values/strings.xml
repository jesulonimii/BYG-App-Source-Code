       \n Hey there! You made it here, I‚Äôm sending you beautiful virtual hugs, I hope you get them.

\n\nMy name is Sissi BYG, I‚Äôm an ardent lover of God, a blogger, and a story teller. I came on the online space on a search for answers.

\n\nSo this is it; I‚Äôve been a church girl all my life (I probably say this all the time. Lol), but I realized as much as I was born and brought up in the church (literally), I had a lot of questions.

\n\nI had so many questions I needed answers to. I searched everywhere for the answers, and I got tired. Lol. I got tired and decided to just rest.

\n\nIt was in that season of ‚Äúrest‚Äù I sat with God‚Äôs word and poco-a-poco, my eyes began to see the truth in God‚Äôs word, that season of my life, I screamed and cried with so much joy, such a thing of joy to finally recognize who I am in Christ and the power I wield (I‚Äôm still screaming).

\n\nAlong the line, I got the inspiration to bring answers to burning questions in the hearts of people that might have been like me. We started from Facebook, to Instagram, Twitter, and other social media platforms as God empowers us.

\n\nWe are a budding nation of Jesus stans and it‚Äôs so amazing to do this. It‚Äôs my prayer and desire that your eyes be opened to the truth and knowledge of God‚Äôs word.

\n\nHere‚Äôs me inviting and welcoming you to a journey of bliss and unending beauty in Godüî•
